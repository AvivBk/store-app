The project in react typescript presents an online store of products,
consisting of three different pages using pagination, on the first page products all of the manufacturer's products, 
on the second page a to-do list where the user adds a task to himself and marks when he is finished
and on the third page the store itself where the customer drags items from the manufacturer's list and dropping in his cart.
At each stage, the cart displays the total prices of the items in it and the option to empty and buy quickly.
The application works against a node with a mock server on local port 8000.

toDo: change the cart buttons as well as the data pull to be using react-redux
